# Best practices for automated feedback

- Measure twice, cut once (verify the correctness of your tests).

- Use rounding & type coercion to write robust tests.

- Use hashing to hide solutions for visible tests.

- Test your tests on the students compute environment.

- Abstract your tests to a script that is sourced/imported into the students literate code document.

- Don't give automated feedback on everything.
