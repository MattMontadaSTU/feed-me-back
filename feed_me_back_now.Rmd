# Automated feedback: 
# why and how?

---

## The why

.todo[There is probably better phrasing, keep thinking...]

--
.pull-left[
.center[
.huge[`r emo::ji("point_right")`] <br>
.large[**Nudging**] <br>
students towards the right answer, especially in formative assessments
]
]
--
.pull-right[
.center[
.huge[`r emo::ji("heavy_plus_sign")`] <br>
.large[**Scaling**] <br>
up efficiency of grading faster than (human) resources
]
]

---

.todo[fix two column formatting]

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
means <- rnorm(10) %>% round(2)
```

.sample-question[
Suppose 10 means from a simulated sampling distribution is stored in a vector called `means`.
```{r}
means
```
What is the value of the first mean?
]
--
<br>
.pull-left[
.sample-answer[
```{r error=TRUE}
mean[1]
```
]
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.align="right"}
knitr::include_graphics("illustrations/student.png")
```
]

---

## Nudging

.hand-blue[Not all feedback is useful, at least not for beginners...]

<br>

Providing helpful feedback can help them nudge them towards success:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mean[1]
```

.todo[Figure out why width isn't working below, want messages to be wrapped.]

```{r echo=FALSE}
options(width=500)
ui_oops("`mean` is a function and a function doesn't have elements that can be subsetted with square brackets.")
ui_info("`means` is the vector of sample means calculated earlier.")
```

---

.sample-question[
Visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage of cars from the `mpg` dataset, conditional on year of manufacture.
]

--
<br>
.sample-answer[
There is a strong, positive, linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of cars. Year does not seem to be related to either variable.
```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=9, dpi=300, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x = hwy, y = cty, fill=year)) +geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```
]

---

class: middle

.pull-left[
.sample-feedback[
- You mention a linear relationship, however your plot uses a loess fit to visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage. Also, the plot displays the uncertainty around the fit, but you haven't addressed it in your narrative.
- Year should be mapped to the `color` aesthetic, not `fill`. 
- Plot styling: Use informative axis labels, noting units of measurement. Also, give an informative title to your plot.
- Code styling: Use consistent spacing around operators (e.g ` = `) and line breaks after `+` in each layer of your ggplot.
]
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("illustrations/teacher.png")
```
]

## Scaling

.hand-blue[Our courses are growing, and that's a good thing, right?]

--

- Such a simple question, so much feedback to give!

- Students turning in their work as R Markdown documents makes collecting submissions including code and narrative straightforward.

- Providing feedback on both the code and narrative is not scalable unless (human) resources dedicated to your course grow proportionally with enrolments.

## Best practices for automated feedback

- Measure twice, cut once (verify the correctness of your tests).

- Use rounding & type coercion to write robust tests.

- Use hashing to hide solutions for visible tests.

- Test your tests on the students compute environment.

- Abstract your tests to a script that is sourced/imported into the students literate code document.

- Don't give automated feedback on everything.
