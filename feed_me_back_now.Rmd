## The what and the why

.pull-left[

students towards the right answer, especially in formative assessments

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
means <- rnorm(10) %>% round(2)
```

.sample-question[
Suppose 10 means from a simulated sampling distribution is stored in a vector called `means`.
```{r}
means
```
What is the value of the first mean?
]

.pull-left-wide[
.sample-answer[

mean[1]
```

knitr::include_graphics("images/student.png")
```
]

---

## Nudging

.hand-blue[Not all feedback is useful, at least not for beginners...]

<br>

Providing helpful feedback can help them nudge them towards success:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mean[1]
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
ui_oops("`mean` is a function and a function doesn't have elements that can be subsetted with square brackets.")
ui_info("`means` is the vector of sample means calculated earlier.")
```

---

.sample-question[
Visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage of cars from the `mpg` dataset, conditional on year of manufacture.
]

--
<br>
.sample-answer[
There is a strong, positive, linear relationship between the city and highway mileage of cars. Year does not seem to be related to either variable.
```{r message=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=9, dpi=300, out.width="70%"}
ggplot(mpg,aes(x = hwy, y = cty, fill=year)) +geom_point()+geom_smooth()
```
]

---

class: middle

.pull-left-wide[
.sample-feedback[
- You mention a linear relationship, however your plot uses a loess fit to visualise the relationship between city and highway mileage. Also, the plot displays the uncertainty around the fit, but you haven't addressed it in your narrative.
- Year should be mapped to the `color` aesthetic, not `fill`. 
- Plot styling: Use informative axis labels, noting units of measurement. Also, give an informative title to your plot.
- Code styling: Use consistent spacing around operators (e.g ` = `) and line breaks after `+` in each layer of your ggplot.

]
.pull-right-narrow[
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/teacher.png")
```
]

## Scaling

.hand-blue[Our courses are growing, and that's a good thing, right?]

--

- Students turning in their work as R Markdown documents makes collecting submissions including code and narrative straightforward.

--

- Providing feedback on both the code and narrative is not scalable unless (human) resources dedicated to your course grow proportionally with enrolments.

## learnr

- **learnr** is an R package that makes it easy to create interactive tutorials from R Markdown documents.

- Tutorials can include:
  - Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations
  - Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Interactive Shiny components

## gradethis

Companion to the learnr package, **gradethis** provides multiple methods to grade learnr exercises:

- `grade_code()`: Grade code against a solution
- `grade_conditions()`: Grade all specified conditions
- `grade_result()`: Grade result of exercise code

## FAQ for learnr and gradethis

--

**Q: What is the best way to get started?**

Start with exercise code chunks for developing analysis and multiple choice 
questions for assessment. [[example]](https://minecr.shinyapps.io/08-modeling-multiple/)

--

**Q: Is it possible to record student data?**

Yes, though not trivial, at this point. See [**submitter**](https://github.com/dtkaplan/submitr) by Danny Kaplan.

A solution that is "good enough" for formative exercises: embed a Google/Microsoft/etc. Form at the end and ask students to "sign in" their work.

## Best practices for automated feedback

--

- Measure twice, cut once (verify the correctness of your tests). üìèüìè ‚úÇÔ∏è

--

- Use rounding & type coercion to write robust tests. üí™

--

- Use hashing to hide solutions for visible tests. üïµÔ∏è

--

- Test your tests on the students compute environment. üíª

--

- Abstract your tests to a script that is sourced/imported into the students literate code document. üìÅ

--

- Don't give automated feedback on everything. üôà
